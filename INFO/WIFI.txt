https://askubuntu.com/questions/832087/how-to-install-tp-link-wn822n-on-ubuntu/832092#832092

I suggest that, with a temporary working internet connection by ethernet, 
tethered or whatever means possible, open a terminal and do:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/jeremyb31/rtl8192eu-linux-driver
cd rtl8192eu-linux-driver
make ARCH=aarch64
make
sudo make install
sudo modprobe 8192eu

You wireless should now be working.

When Update Manager installs a later kernel version, also known as 
linux-image, after the required reboot, then recompile:

cd rtl8192eu-linux-driver
make clean
make ARCH=aarch64
make
sudo make install
sudo modprobe 8192eu
